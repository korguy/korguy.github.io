Hi 👋, my name is Hyun Kang. I received a Master's degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4id34ogAAAAJ&hl=ko\">Prof. In-Kwon Lee</a>. Before joining graduate school, I received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Yonsei University.
<br/>
👀 My research focuses on 3D reconstruction and generative models, with a strong belief in the pervasive impact of large model priors. In 2025, I see AI agents and reasoning frameworks, leveraging LLMs as crucial building blocks, as holding the most significant promise. I'm dedicated to delving deeper into these areas.

👨‍🦯 As a person, I love reading books 📚 (<a href="/2024/05/28/books_in_graduate/">see the list of books I read during graduate school</a>), exploring fashion 👔, and attending exhibitions 🖼️. I think what they share in common is that little details matter a lot. Many authors share similar ideas, but what makes a book distinguishable among many others is the small insights. Similarly, little details are what give identity to fashion and artworks. I also strive to have my own opinion on everything I believe matters, and this makes me unique.
